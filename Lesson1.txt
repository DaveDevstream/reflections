How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

By being able to correct mistakes easily and reverting back to a copy where the mistake did not exist.
commits are like checkpoints
each represents a version of the content at one point in time.
git forces you to write a description on each commit.

git is a type of version control
commits are a part of git
git diff command operates on commits

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

it's good to make meaningful commits to represent one unit of work. An autosave function might save in the middle of creating a new method for program where it does not work, causing confusion when you load it again.
