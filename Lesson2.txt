How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area may or maybe not contain all the files in a WD
It only contains the files I changed which I want to make a save point for.
I may have changed other files but want to create another commit with them included.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Maybe you fixed two things in two different files at the same time but you want to add each fix as a seperate commit
you can then add file1 to the staging area, commit that by writing something meaningful and then add file2 and repeat the process
you will than have added one commit for each fix making the repo more meaningful.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If I wanted to test out a new feature but keep the master clean, then merge later
