Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

a fork is a copy of a repo on github, to your own github account. you can then pull it to your local machine, edit and push back to the remote.
you can not push changes to the repo which was forked unless you were added as a collobaroator. 
This new forked repo will exist outside of the original.

A clone is a repo which you pulled down to a local machine. once you push it back up to your own account, it could be called a fork.
you could clone a repo which you have been made a colloborator of.

a branch is a when you want to develop a new feature or try something out without ruining the working code in the master branch.
you can easily return back to when the code was stable before you branched....or you could decide to merge the branch back into master when it is working correctly.
